Topic coverage is subject to available time. Students will develop theoretical and applied proficiency in the following areas in computer graphics:

3D Transformations
Viewing 3D scenes
Shading
Rendering pipeline and the GPU
Texturing
Polygonal meshes and other modelling techniques
Colour spaces
Light and colour
Ray-geometry intersection
Backwards raytracing
Ray marching
Computer Animation
Most assignment and lab programming will be done in JavaScript and WebGL (GLSL).

Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes
The objective of CSC305 is to give students an understanding of the algorithms, data structures, and mathematics required to develop interactive graphics systems. Students should be familiar with (but not necessarily experts in):

Introductory linear algebra
Calculus
Introductory physics
Course assignments are designed to help students get familiar with the algorithms and methods used in both the real-time rendering pipeline, i.e. shader based render, and offline ray tracing, while introducing them to concepts in modelling, animation, rendering, colour theory, and perception.

Learning outcomes include:

understanding the modern real-time graphics pipeline
understanding the transformations used in the graphics pipeline
understanding projections, projection matrices, and their derivations
understanding the development of shader-based rendering methods to implement the real-time graphics pipeline
understanding texturing and UV mapping
understanding heirarchical transformation modelling and developing animated linked transformations
understanding both real time and offline ray tracing and ray marching methods for high-fidelity rendering
